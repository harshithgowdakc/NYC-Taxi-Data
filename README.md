## Supervised ML- 
Regression model using NYC-Taxi-Data Demand Prediction Data Set.






## Business  Context: 

The primary goal is to develop a predictive model that accurately estimates the total ride duration of taxi trips in New York City, using data provided by the NYC Taxi and Limousine Commission dataset. The model should be able to incorporate variables such as pickup time, geo-coordinates, and number of passengers, and should provide predictions with a high level of accuracy.

The objective of this model is to enable businesses in the transportation industry to optimize their operations, improve the user experience, and increase overall efficiency. By accurately predicting ride duration, transportation companies, ride-sharing platforms, and delivery and logistics companies can better manage their resources and schedules, reduce wait times, and increase customer satisfaction. Additionally, the model can provide valuable insights for city planners and traffic management authorities, enabling them to make data-driven decisions to improve transportation infrastructure and reduce congestion.

Ultimately, the business goal of building a predictive model for taxi ride duration in New York City is to drive efficiency and improve the user experience for both passengers and drivers, while providing valuable insights for stakeholders across a range of industries.
