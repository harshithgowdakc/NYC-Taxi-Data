## Supervised ML- 
Regression model using NYC-Taxi-Data Demand Prediction Data Set.
The NYC Taxi Data Demand Prediction Data Set provides information on taxi trips in New York City, including pickup time, pickup and dropoff coordinates, and other variables that can influence the total ride duration. To build a regression model to predict the total ride duration of taxi trips in the city, the dataset can be preprocessed to clean and prepare the data for analysis.

The next step would be to select appropriate features that are likely to be good predictors of ride duration. These features could include pickup time, pickup and dropoff coordinates, distance between pickup and dropoff points, and other variables that may affect ride duration. Feature engineering techniques can be applied to create additional features that may enhance the predictive power of the model.

Once the features have been selected and engineered, a regression model can be trained using an appropriate algorithm such as linear regression, decision tree regression, or random forest regression. The model can then be evaluated using various performance metrics such as mean squared error, root mean squared error, and R-squared to determine its accuracy and generalization ability.

Finally, the trained model can be used to predict the total ride duration of new taxi trips based on the selected features. The model can be integrated into transportation systems and ride-sharing platforms to provide more accurate and reliable ride duration estimates to passengers and drivers, as well as to optimize transportation operations and improve the user experience.

Overall, a regression model using the NYC Taxi Data Demand Prediction Data Set can provide valuable insights into transportation patterns and infrastructure planning in New York City, while also driving efficiency and improving the user experience for passengers and drivers.



## Business  Context: 

The primary goal is to develop a predictive model that accurately estimates the total ride duration of taxi trips in New York City, using data provided by the NYC Taxi and Limousine Commission dataset. The model should be able to incorporate variables such as pickup time, geo-coordinates, and number of passengers, and should provide predictions with a high level of accuracy.

The objective of this model is to enable businesses in the transportation industry to optimize their operations, improve the user experience, and increase overall efficiency. By accurately predicting ride duration, transportation companies, ride-sharing platforms, and delivery and logistics companies can better manage their resources and schedules, reduce wait times, and increase customer satisfaction. Additionally, the model can provide valuable insights for city planners and traffic management authorities, enabling them to make data-driven decisions to improve transportation infrastructure and reduce congestion.

Ultimately, the business goal of building a predictive model for taxi ride duration in New York City is to drive efficiency and improve the user experience for both passengers and drivers, while providing valuable insights for stakeholders across a range of industries.
